## Installation

To add the slider to your Angular project:
```
npm install --save @angular-slider/ngx-slider
```

Once installed, add the slider to your `app.module.ts`:
```typescript
import { NgxSliderModule } from '@angular-slider/ngx-slider';

...

@NgModule({
   ...
   imports: [
     ...
     NgxSliderModule,
    ...
   ],
   ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Sample usage

Now you can use the slider component in your app components, for example in `app.component.ts`:
```typescript
import { Options } from '@angular-slider/ngx-slider';
...

@Component({...})
export class AppComponent {
  value: number = 100;
  options: Options = {
    floor: 0,
    ceil: 200
  };
}
```

And in template file `app.component.html`:
```html
<ngx-slider [(value)]="value" [options]="options"></ngx-slider>
```

## Documentation
Full API documentation is available on [official website](https://angular-slider.github.io/ngx-slider/docs).

## Styling

An overview of how to apply your own style to the slider is described in [STYLING.md](STYLING.md).

## Animations

As of v1.2.0 the slider features CSS animations of slider movement. If you prefer the previous behaviour, without animations, you can set the flag `animate: false` in your slider options.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

In addition to mouse/touch events, the slider can also be controlled through keyboard. The available shortcuts are:
 - right/up arrow - increase by single step,
 - left/down arrow - decrease by single step,
 - page up - increase by 10% of slider range,
 - page down - decrease by 10% of slider range,
 - home - move to minimum value,
 - end - move to maximum value.

## Tooltips

The slider allows for customising how to implement tooltips. See [TOOLTIPS.md](TOOLTIPS.md) for more information.
